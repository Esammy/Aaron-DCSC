ðŸš€ Priority Improvement Strategies
1. Advanced Feature Engineering (High Impact)
Current Issue: The model only uses basic transformer features. We can enhance this significantly.
Improvements to implement:
# Add linguistic features
- Readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG)
- Sentiment analysis features
- Named entity recognition features
- Part-of-speech patterns
- Syntactic complexity measures
- Emotional tone analysis
Implementation: Create a new feature extractor that combines:
Current transformer embeddings
Hand-crafted linguistic features
Style-specific features (punctuation patterns, capitalization, emoji usage)
2. Enhanced Architecture Components
A. Improved Attention Mechanism
# Replace current Post_Attn with multi-head hierarchical attention
- Document-level attention
- Sentence-level attention  
- Word-level attention
- Cross-attention between style and content
B. Better Disentanglement
# Current: Simple sigmoid gating
# Improve to: Variational disentanglement with KL divergence
- VAE-based style/content separation
- Mutual information minimization
- Orthogonality constraints
3. Advanced Training Strategies
A. Curriculum Learning
# Train on easy examples first, then hard ones
1. Start with clear fake/real distinctions
2. Gradually introduce edge cases
3. Finally train on cross-domain examples
B. Ensemble Methods
# Combine multiple model variants
- DCSC + domain-specific models
- Style-focused + content-focused models
- Multiple random initializations
4. Enhanced Data Augmentation
Current MIXUP can be improved:
# Advanced augmentation strategies:
1. Back-translation augmentation
2. Paraphrasing with preserved labels
3. Cross-domain style transfer
4. Adversarial text generation
5. Loss Function Enhancements
Current multi-level contrastive loss can be enhanced:
# Add focal loss for hard examples
# Add consistency regularization
# Add adversarial loss for robustness
